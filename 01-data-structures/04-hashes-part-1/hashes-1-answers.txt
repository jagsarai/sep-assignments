Doubling the array each time we are faced with a collision can be a bad idea for couple of reasons. One, we will be faced with memory fragmentation, where the repeated coping and doubling of array may lead to not having enough contigous memory sapces. In addition, since arrays are stored in linear memory space, storing long arrays, will cause the memory manager to frequently try to find enough linear memory space open to keep the array. Secondly, coping the array and then storing the values in the a new array will be a slow process for long arrays. It will have to go through each index of the array to perform the copy.
